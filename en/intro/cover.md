# Introduction

---------------------------------------------

This first section introduces the basic building blocks of the Elm language, such as modules, functions, and the type system.

As Elm attempts to ease the web development process by playing to the strengths of a functional programming language, as a reader of this book, you are likely be port of one of these two groups.

Developers already convinced of the advantages of functional languages looking for a powerful framework for creating web applications. Web developers who either are dissatisfied with their existing tools or are looking to expand their horizons into the functional world.

This book requires no previous experience about the functional paradigm. However, some general knowledge about programming, such as the concept of branching and conditionals, and some minimal practice with the shell or console, is assumed.

In this book you’ll mostly work with the elm REPL, because it’s a simple and efficient way of experimenting with the language. Make sure you’ve installed Elm version 0.17. Simply follow the instructions from the official Elm site.

As examples grow more complex, we will start using the try/elm online environment.
