**Elm 0.??**, **copied, please ignore** 

# Eager by default

Elm syntax is very similar to Haskell. There is one important difference to keep in mind. Elm is *eager*, unlike Haskell, which is lazy. That means, in Elm, if you call a function, the arguments are fully evaluated before they are passed to the function. Most programming languages are like this, so you won't likely need to think about this very much.
