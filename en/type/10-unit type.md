## Unit Type

There's one special type with only one value of that type. Both the type and value are read as "unit" and written as `()`. Unit is often used as a placeholder value, since if we know the type, we can anticipate the value. (copied from [elm-for-js](https://github.com/elm-guides/elm-for-js/blob/master/How%20to%20Read%20a%20Type%20Annotation.md))

Note that the empty tuple `()` is also a type which can only have a single value: `()`. This value is read as `"unit"` and is the common way to denote an empty value with no specific meaning.

The empty tuple, or "unit", is sometimes used as a placeholder. It is the only value of its type, also called "Unit".
